RGB Label Color Changer
__________________________________

My first java app.

You can change the color of the label in the middle with textfields on the bottom.
Acceptable values are from 0 to 255.
If value is lower than 0 then it changes the input to 200.
If value is higher though, it changes to the maximum acceptable value which is 255.
